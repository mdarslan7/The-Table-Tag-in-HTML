# Handling Requests in React using react-query

When it comes to building modern web applications, handling data fetching and state management can be a bit of a puzzle. However, the days of wrestling with complex state management libraries and writing verbose code for data requests are long gone, thanks to libraries like **react-query**. In this article, we'll dive into the world of handling requests in React using **react-query**, and we promise it's going to make your life as a developer a whole lot easier.

## **Introducing react-query**

**react-query** is a powerful library that simplifies data fetching, caching, synchronization, and updates in React applications. It's like having a super-smart assistant that handles all the nitty-gritty details of managing your application's data for you.

One of the standout features of **react-query** is its ability to abstract away the complexities of making API calls, caching the results, and keeping the data in sync across your components. This means you can spend less time worrying about data management and more time focusing on building awesome user experiences.

## **Installation**

Getting started with **react-query** is a breeze. First, make sure you have a React project set up. If not, you can create one using `create-react-app` or any other method you prefer. Once you're in your project directory, open up your terminal and type:

```bash
npm install react-query
```

Or if you're using Yarn:

```bash
yarn add react-query
```

With **react-query** installed, you're ready to rock!

## **Fetching Data**

Let's dive into the fun part: fetching data. Imagine you're building a todo list application, and you want to fetch a list of todos from your API. With **react-query**, this is incredibly straightforward.

In your component file, import the necessary dependencies:

```javascript
import { useQuery } from 'react-query';
```

Now, let's define a function to fetch our data. This function will be used with **react-query** to handle the data fetching and caching:

```javascript
async function fetchTodos() {
  const response = await fetch('/api/todos');
  return response.json();
}
```

Next, use the `useQuery` hook to fetch and manage your data:

```javascript
function TodoList() {
  const { data, error, isLoading } = useQuery('todos', fetchTodos);

  if (isLoading) {
    return <p>Loading...</p>;
  }

  if (error) {
    return <p>Error: {error.message}</p>;
  }

  return (
    <ul>
      {data.map(todo => (
        <li key={todo.id}>{todo.title}</li>
      ))}
    </ul>
  );
}
```

That's it! You now have a **react-query**\-powered component that fetches and displays your todos. The `useQuery` hook automatically handles caching, refetching, and background data synchronization.

## **Mutating Data**

Fetching data is only half the battle. You also need to update and mutate your data when users add, edit, or delete todos. Once again, **react-query** comes to the rescue.

Let's say you want to add a new todo. First, create a mutation function:

```javascript
async function createTodo(newTodo) {
  const response = await fetch('/api/todos', {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: {
      'Content-Type': 'application/json',
    },
    body: JSON.stringify(newTodo),
  });

  return response.json();
}
```

Now, use the `useMutation` hook to handle the mutation:

```javascript
import { useMutation, useQueryClient } from 'react-query';

function TodoForm() {
  const queryClient = useQueryClient();

  const mutation = useMutation(newTodo => createTodo(newTodo), {
    onSuccess: () => {
      // Invalidate and refetch the todos query to update the list
      queryClient.invalidateQueries('todos');
    },
  });

  const handleSubmit = e => {
    e.preventDefault();
    const formData = new FormData(e.target);
    const newTodo = Object.fromEntries(formData);

    mutation.mutate(newTodo);
  };

  return (
    <form onSubmit={handleSubmit}>
      <input type="text" name="title" placeholder="New Todo" />
      <button type="submit">Add Todo</button>
    </form>
  );
}
```

By using the `useMutation` hook, you're able to handle the mutation and update the cache accordingly. The `onSuccess` callback allows you to trigger a refetch of the todos after a successful mutation.

## **Wrapping Up**

**react-query** is a game-changer when it comes to handling requests in React. It simplifies data fetching, caching, and mutations, allowing you to focus on building features rather than battling with state management. With its intuitive hooks and powerful caching mechanisms, **react-query** streamlines the entire process of handling requests and updating data in your React applications.

So, whether you're building a simple todo app or a complex e-commerce platform, give **react-query** a try. Your future self will thank you for the reduced complexity and enhanced developer experience it brings to the table. *Happy coding!* ðŸš€
